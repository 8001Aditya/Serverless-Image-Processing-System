**Serverless Image Upload and Processing System**
This project implements a serverless image upload and processing system on AWS. It enables users to upload images via an API endpoint, processes these images (resizes them), and stores metadata in a DynamoDB table. The processed images are saved back to the S3 bucket in a separate directory.

Features
  --- AWS S3: Stores uploaded and processed images.
  --- AWS Lambda: Processes images (e.g., resizing) using a Lambda function triggered upon image upload.
  --- AWS API Gateway: Provides an API endpoint to upload images to S3.
  --- AWS DynamoDB: Stores metadata about each uploaded image, such as URL, size, and upload time.

Architecture
The system operates in a serverless architecture using AWS Free Tier services:
  --- API Gateway exposes an endpoint for uploading images.
  --- S3 Bucket receives the images.
  --- Lambda Function resizes and processes images when they are uploaded to S3.
  --- DynamoDB stores metadata (URL, size, timestamp) for each image.

Setup Instructions
  1. Prerequisites
    --- AWS Free Tier account with access to S3, Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB.
    --- Basic knowledge of AWS services and AWS Management Console.
    --- Python or Node.js environment for writing Lambda function code.
  
  2. Steps to Set Up
    Step 1. Create the S3 Bucket
    
    Step 2. Go to the S3 Console and create a bucket named my-image-processing-bucket. 
            Enable versioning and set lifecycle rules as needed for cost optimization.
            Create the Lambda Function for Image Processing
    
    Step 3. Go to Lambda Console and create a function named ImageProcessingFunction.
    
    Step 4. Choose Python 3.8 (or Node.js 14.x) as the runtime.
  
    Step 5. Write your lambda function accordingly.
  
  3. Set Up API Gateway for Image Uploads
    --- Go to API Gateway Console and create a new REST API named ImageUploadAPI.
    --- Add a POST method under a resource (e.g., /upload) to handle image uploads.
    --- Integrate this method with S3 PutObject and specify the bucketâ€™s ARN.
  
  4. Create DynamoDB Table for Metadata Storage
    --- Go to DynamoDB Console and create a table named ImageMetadata.
    --- Set ImageID as the partition key of type String.
    
  5. Assign IAM Roles and Permissions
    --- Attach the AmazonS3FullAccess policy to your Lambda function's role.
    --- Attach the AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess policy to allow DynamoDB interactions.
    --- Grant the API Gateway permission to upload files to S3.
  
  6. Deploy and Test the System
    --- Deploy your API in API Gateway and obtain the Invoke URL.
    --- Use a REST client (e.g., Postman) to upload an image via the API endpoint.
    --- Check the S3 bucket for the uploaded and processed images and verify DynamoDB entries for metadata.

Repository Structure
|-- lambda_function.py          # Lambda function code
|-- api_gateway_config.json     # API Gateway configuration (optional)
|-- cloudformation_template.yaml # CloudFormation template to set up the architecture (optional)

Usage
--- Upload an Image: Send a POST request with an image file to the API Gateway endpoint.
--- Check Processed Image: Processed images will appear in the processed/ folder in the S3 bucket.
--- View Metadata: Check the DynamoDB table for metadata on uploaded images.
